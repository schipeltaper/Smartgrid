# Results
In this folder, we save results that we think are worth saving.

## Format
The result-files will be saved in json files with exactly the format that is needed for check50

## Name
We name each result as follows:
    [name algorithm]\_[district number]\_[version number].json
where the [name algorithm] is the name of that specific algorithm,
the [district number] is the number of the district (1, 2 or 3)
and the [version number] is the number of results we now have with this combination of district and algorithm
